# ADE-HAT
An earthquake detection approach (ADE-HAT) that Hybridizes the Array Beam Detection (ABD) and Template Matched Filter (TMF) methods. 

The ABD method doesn't demand much priori information of earthquakes and can be a proper candidate for EQ detection using DAS data, which are commonly aquired using the exsisting dark fiber and deployed after the destructive EQs. However, the some of the small and transient events could be hidden in the long-term coda waves generated by some relatively strong EQs. The strong EQs can be detected easily using the ABD method and then become powerful template events for a furthur re-scanning of the long-term coda window. The implementation of this ADE-HAT approach is proposed in our paper entitled with "A Hybrid Earthquake Detection Method for Distributed Acoustic Sensing Array Data and Its Application to the 2022 Menyuan Earthquake Sequence".
The so-called ABD method (originally called array detection method) is described in the paper "Distributed Acoustic Sensing Using Dark Fiber for Array Detection of Regional Earthquakes" by Nayak et al. (2021)

The TMF method is implemented using the FMF package with the help of the GPU accelaration (Beauc√© et al., 2018). The title of the paper is "Fast Matched Filter (FMF): an efficient seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures."

The ABD method is implemented with numpy, scipy, and numba. The usage of the FMF can be found in https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter.
